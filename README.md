# Cloud Memory [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/krasnoukhov/cloudmemory.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/krasnoukhov/cloudmemory)

### From memorabilia to ephemera 

The Cloud Memory project explores the idea that in the world where everything has been photographed, one might not need to take a picture, but just pull it out from a "cloud" of shared personal imagery.
 
The website features 5 pages of an old photo album I found at a flea market in Paris and filled with Instagram photos corresponding to the original captions. Each photo is a stream generated with a specific tag or location, according to the original caption. Every time you open the album, you see new pictures. Instagram photos can't get old, they can only go away.
